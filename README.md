## University project - Java Bluetooth Beacon scanning app for Android

This project was a University project with other developers to create an Android application that would scan for Bluetooth emitting low energy beacons. The application would run in the background on the end-user device, and when a beacon was found, a push notification would be sent displaying certain information.

The use case of the application would be for tourism, to display location specific information about a given area.

This was completed as part of a team development effort in circa ~ 2017.
